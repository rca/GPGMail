GPGMail 2.6
===============

New
----
### El Capitan stable
* GPGMail 2.6 stable is rolled out for 10.9 - 10.11. [#834]

### VoiceOver support
* VoiceOver support has been made fully functional on 10.11. All GPGMail elements can be reached and worked with. Known limitations: 10.10 can not access the OpenPGP indicator, 10.9 as 10.10 and button state is not announced. We suggest all of our blind users to update to 10.11 and would be really excited to hear your feedback on this.

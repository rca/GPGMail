GPGMail 2.5b4 - Release Notes
============================

Features
--------

### Intuitive security indicator for encrypted mails

* Until now we showed an open lock to indicate that the mail has been decrypted. But actually there are only two states: successful decryption (which now shows a closed lock) or no decryption at all due to an error (which results in an error message). We think the new behavior is much more intuitive. The open lock for decrypted messages was irritating and did worry quite a few users who though the encryption had been broken. [#777]

Bugfixes
--------

*  Assertion failure when using legary PGP inline mode: Creating inline PGP message works again as expected. [#788]
*  Drafts were not saved if the signing key information was not available when saving a draft. [#791]
*  Correctly detect inline PGP in text/html messages. [#787]

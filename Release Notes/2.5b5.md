GPGMail 2.5b5 - Release Notes
============================

Features
--------

### Show warning before sending an unencrypted reply to an encrypted message

* Your security is important and sending an unencrypted reply to an encrypted message can pose a serious security threat since information might be leaked.
* We now display an informative warning message which explains the situation and gives you the change to revise the draft you are about to send.


Bugfixes
--------

*   10.10: ensure selecting a specific key in the "From:" menu when composing a new message is possible when more than one secret key is available for the same email address. [#809]
*  When a new message was created via Apple Script, Mail.app would crash under certain circumstances. Fixes this issue once and for all! [#799, #804]
*  GPGMail no longer clutters Console.app with "error CFBundle RegexKit.framework Data couldn't be read" messages. [#796]
*  Attachments of weird inline PGP encrypted messages from Windows are now properly displayed. [#677]
*  Mail no longer raises an exception if the font information is not available when generating the security header. [#795]

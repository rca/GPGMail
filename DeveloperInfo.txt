How to compile GPGMail?
=======================
GPGMail sources come with a copy of the official MacGPGME source code.

You need first to download and install libgpg-error and libgpgme. Read the 
README in MacGPGME folder for instructions. Then you can compile GPGMail project, 
which will compile MacGPGME sources too.

Release notes for v47:
* Some more debug logs
* Fixed problem with GPGOpenPGPExecutablePath

FIXME When _receiving_ signed+encrypted message with attachment, GPGMail says it's unsigned
FIXME Unable to forward encrypted message as decrypted attachment (possible in PGPmail?)
FIXME Unable to decrypt attached encrypted message
FIXME Multiple encrypted parts
TESTME Automatic decryption/verification - no deadlock? No.
FIXME HTML when no alternate
FIXME PGP options not restored in drafts - still unable to; posing on ComposeBackEnd??
FIXME Use key arrows in focussed decrypted message -> gets re-encrypted. Same when resizing window. But no problem when using page up/down buttons, nor space.
TODO Update modified nibs for localized ones
FIXME Sometimes a decrypted message is displayed in plain text instead of rich text - HOW TO REPRODUCE?
FIXME Crash when no secret key to decrypt, or cancelled password panel? Maybe automatic decryption? - HOW TO REPRODUCE?
TESTME with gpg2; both gpg & gpg2 or gpg2 alone
FIXME Invalid signatures when contains all usenet sig + attachment?
FIXME Unable to decrypt encrypted attachments automatically - see Oct 23 2007
FIXME (Leopard) If encrypted message has associated TODO, then decrypting message masks TODO. Because can no longer make link from TODO to decrypted message?
FIXME (Leopard) No support for Time Machine: when navigating in Time Machine, PGP controls are not available, thus messages can't be decrypted.
FIXME With autoverification ON, when receiving a junk signed message, the junk banner disappears when signature banner is displayed
TODO If HTML encrypted message misses plain text alternative, decode HTML and decrypt it?
BUG Reply to a message, whose sender you have the public key, but whose recipients you miss some public keys; message should be encrypted; click on the reply all button; message should not be encrypted (missing keys), but it is! GPGMail doesn't reevaluate the addresses.
BUG Crash or infinite loop with auto-decryption of encrypted PGP inline message with encrypted attachment.
BUG Invalid signature (or verification?) in PGP-MIME messages containing usenet ('-- ') signatures; works in PGP-inline messages
BUG Sometimes OpenPGP-signed messages are generated with 2 empty lines after the 'Content-Type: multipart/alternative', instead of one, and some mail servers remove one of the empty lines, thus invalidating message signature - see Jim Syler, Mar 7 2006
SOLVED Stack trace logs in console, due to MailTags; these exception are normally thrown and caught by GPGMail


? PENDING BUG: Was returning a "No data" error WITHOUT decrypting data when decrypting message which was also signed, and key was not available, AND automatic key search WAS enabled. If no automatic search, then decrypts but warns it is missing key. -> correct gpgme first; asked bug-gpgme.
??? Better problem reporting when using RSA key (signing) (GPGMail#2071+2244)
? Panther: disable S/MIME signing and encryption when PGP signing or encryption is enabled. GPGMail#2256
TODO Use all known keyservers when verifying/searching
? "General Error" when using "by default use OpenPGP-MIME"? GPGMail#2297 - Unable to reproduce; similar to other problem GPGMail#2071?? Main key was missing uid.
BUG installer: sometimes the OS9 Mail is launched instead -> use com.apple.mail as app

? New FAQ: PGP & S/MIME are incompatible formats
(? New FAQ: on 10.3, sig attachments are not shown)
(New FAQ: GPGMail/gpg 1.2.x stuck when encrypting)
New FAQ: How to remove undesired keys?
New FAQ: Internal error: *** subrange... -> multiple encrypted parts
New FAQ: timeout on keyserver operations + new GPGPreferences option
New FAQ: 'No data' when decrypting signed message without signer's key; fixed with 1.4.x? (use sign+encrypt in one op to verify)
New FAQ: more info about error message when hash algo not RFC3156 compliant + new option to accept it (with warning, once)
New FAQ: a disabled key CAN sign, but not encrypt, unless used with --encrypt-to or --hidden-encrypt-to
New FAQ: can I import/export keys?
New FAQ: can I exchange emails with non-GPGMail clients?
New FAQ: *-steps encryption - HOWTO
New FAQ: messages MUST be cached on client-side, else verifying MIME signature doesn't work
New FAQ: line wrapping param use
New FAQ: Some mail servers break OpenPGP-signed messages by reordering some header contents (Wannadoo or .mac) - see G. Pineau, Mar 8 2006

KNOWN BUG: when working offline, it may happen that a signature verification fails though signature is valid, in case there are attachments in message (except signature)
? KNOWN BUG: GPGMail doesn't support signing with RSA keys (old PGP keys).
KNOWN BUG: "security header" for OpenPGP signed or signed+encrypted messages set ~correctly, but after mailbox has been closed/reopened.
? KNOWN BUG: "reply" mark is not set when you reply to a decrypted message from the singleMessageViewer only.
KNOWN BUG: incomplete Korean translation

? Crash in gpgme:gpgme_op_keylist_start(); GPGMail#2418; seems it's a low memory condition crash
? NEW FEATURE: after encryption failure due to missing keys, user can now select to send unencrypted to missing keys, and encrypted to keys -> multiple messages
? Crash in gpgme:keylist_colon_handler(); GPGMail#2465 - forwarded to Markus Brinkmann
? NEW FEATURE: send owner's key
? NEW FEATURE: combine decrypt & verify menus/buttons, because only one can be active at the same time
? New: use .pkg and modify defaults for all users, in /Library/Preferences/ (see GPGMail#...)
? NEW FEATURE: add possibility to disable GPGMail (reenabled in prefs)
? BUG GPGMail#2112: after decryption, banner shows verification state, not signature/error state!!! Key's not found.
? BUG: invalid sig in discuss-gnustep#4362
? 8bits chars are now allowed in SMTP -> remove assertions, if any, but only on receiving, because Mail still uses 7bit (except bug)
? NEW: for passphrase timeout in prefs, use special widget
? New: when reading clear-text PGP messages, use "Charset" PGP header when present. When encrypting, create that header. See RFC2440. Default is UTF-8.
? NEW: display keyID in long format
? NEW: when has only expired keys, suggest user to search for new key
? NEW: use text attachments to display more info about keys, e.g. in sig verif view display an icon next to signer to show trust. Do it wherever possible.
? BUG: some messages can't be verified by gpg 1.4, but are OK with gpg 1.2; see R. Goldsmith's messages. Related to new way of doing in gpg 1.4 AND bug (unstripped tailing spaces in messages) in GPGMail; new option in gpg 1.4.1

TODO Tolerate non RFC3156 hash algo, but warn user (and allow changing algo)
TODO Refactoring of prefs: regroup by theme, remove some? See Robert's email (encryptAll should be fully replaced by encryptWhenPossible?)
TODO In pref pane, add reference (+link?) to ABKey plug-in
TODO Add "Sign when recipients know PGP" (i.e. when there are PGP public keys for recipients)
TODO In key chooser, add new column 'Additional Info' that shows 'expired', 'revoked', etc.
TODO In key chooser, add new column ownertrust
TODO Review key chooser: make non modal, in panel; user can search for keys (search field like for address panel), display lot of info, D&D(?), and pass selected keys to mainWindow -> can choose for encryption, for export

v39
TODO In menu items, mark in red revoked/expired keys
(TODO Encryption progress panel: make it a sheet.) Impossible, because window is no longer displayed
BUG Invalid (created?) signatures when format=flowed in MIME(really??); needs gpg 1.4.1 special option (which one??) to avoid that.
BUG If AB entry says 'encrypt' or 'MIME' but there's no (valid or not) PGP key, ignore option
TODO Use the headers to show signature information?
TODO Show ownertrust info, with warning sign when owner not trusted
TODO Add option to automatically remove inline PGP signatures in replies.
BUG in Cocoa 10.4.2: impossible to type passphrase with composed characters, e.g. acute accent and e; no problem when keyboard provides accented character in one key press
TODO Disable S/MIME on a per-message basis, e.g. when PGP encryption/signing is on
BUG Automatic decryption fails often: still displays encrypted message
TODO Use Smart Crash Report (10.4 only?) -> create SOPE app
TODO GPGPreferences: support for key server connection timeout
BUG Private key is actually unselected when it seems to be selected -> user might be unable to encrypt anything, due to rules
TODO In pref pane, add 'export config' button to gather GPGMail userDefaults
TODO No longer hide unusable keys, but explain why they are unusable, and prevent automatic choice
BUG GPGMail not invoked when message created automatically by rule (because no UI) -> should provide applescript, or intercept the delivery
TODO New toolbar button showing key caching state - clicking it clears cache (valid only for memory cache, not keychain)
TODO Warn when replying/forwarding unencrypted to encrypted message
TODO Auto-decrypt when passphrase is in cache
TODO New pref to not even show passphrase-disclosure checkbox in passphrase panel
TODO When showing signed message, display image in signer's key (if any) instead of sender's image (if any), with PGP icon/cert/padlock on it
(TODO New mailbundle for PGP timestamping service (http://www.itconsult.co.uk/stamper/stampinf.htm)) No longer active? Very old.
TODO Modify smart addresses tokens to display a PGP icon, when there is a key for the user; add PGP menu items too to the token popup menu - see AddressAttachment
BUG/TODO Signature encapsulation is done only for OpenPGP/MIME, not for inline-PGP - either implement it, or change tooltip in prefs
BUG Still too many gpg operations to retrieve keys: why is cache not used?
BUG Even reloading keys doesn't recognize new private keys?
TODO Automatic rules diagnosis available for user, i.e. display user all evaluated criteria
TODO In keyserver list, display which server is main, and allow user to change main.
TODO After user downloaded new keys, if current message failed to verify, relaunch message verification
TODO Toolbar button to toggle MIME/inline (when possible)
(TODO Can we now use progress info when encrypting? Not yet implemented with gpg 1.4.8/gpgme 1.4)
TODO When BCC is used and BCC keys are not in non-BCC keys, then issue warning; also, change the pref to simply turn off that warning.
BUG Sometimes OpenPGP-signed messages are generated with 2 empty lines after the 'Content-Type: multipart/alternative', instead of one, and some mail servers remove one of the empty lines, thus invalidating message signature - see Jim Syler, Mar 7 2006
TODO Automatic search of gpg in well-known paths, when GPGOpenPGPExecutablePath has not been set, and set it: /usr/local/bin/gpg2, /usr/local/bin/gpg, /opt/local/bin/gpg2, /opt/local/bin/gpg, /sw/bin/gpg2, /sw/bin/gpg

? OT: Charly's extras: detachable mailbox panel - keyboard shortcuts for rule creation - ability to add additional headers (x-...)

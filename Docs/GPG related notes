Keys and Subkeys

- Each subkey is a new key pair - public key / secret key
- To encrypt or sign a message you need at least one valid key
- either subkey or the primary key
- Subkey are used to build something similar to a certificate tree
- if a node is invalidated, the nodes under it are invalidated as well.
- not necessary to consider them in gpg mail
- Each key has at least one subkey which is automatically created when a new key is created

UIDS

- Each uid is an identity for a key
- A uid allows the key to set a different name or a different email address or similar

@interface Message_GPGMail : NSObject

/**
 Mail.app uses -[Message messageFlags] to gather various internal information
 about the message, including whether the email is encrypted and|or
 signed.
 It's also used to determine whether or not the message error banner
 should be displayed in the event that decrypt or verify of a message
 fails.
 Unfortunately PGP messages are not recognized as signed or encrypted
 and hence, the error banner is never shown.
 
 To fix whenever a PGP encrypted and|or signed message is encountered
 a call to this method temporarily adds the signed (0x00800000) and 
 encrypted bits (0x00000008) to the current flags.
 
 This way the banner is shown for PGP messages as well, since Mail now believes
 this message is indeed encrypted and|or signed.
 
 N.B.: Previously setIvar was used. messageFlags is called a bazillion times
       which caused getIvar to deadlock. DON'T USE setIvar FOR METHODS
       which are called very often.

/**
 It's necessary to hook into this class, since Mail.app only checks
 the message flags, to determine whether a message is signed or encrypted.
 In some occasions though, for PGP processed messages, the message flags are not
 yet set correctly.
 
 For that reason, _evaluateIsDigitallySignedCriterion and _evaluateIsEncryptedCriterion
 use GPGMail's own variables to determine the signed and encrypted status of a message.

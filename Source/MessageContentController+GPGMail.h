/**
 This method is called when the encrypted icon is clicked in a message view.
 It's only used in the case, when encrypted messages should not be decrypted automatically,
 but manually by a user interaction.
 
 It adds some information to the message, so decodeWithContext knows it should return
 the decrypted body.
 
 Calling MessageContentController.reloadCurrentMessageShouldReparseBody: reloads the current
 message in a separate thread, showing a spinner animation while the body data is retrieved
 using decodeWithContext which returns the decrypted message body. 
 Upon receiving the decrypted message body, the spinner animation fades and the decrypted message
 is displayed. (All done automatically by Mail! that's how I like it!)
 
 TODO: Only decrypt the message, if it's not already displayed decrypted.

/**
 Invoked by Mail.app if the user selects a message.
 
 It's important to intercept this call, to set an internal variable UserSelectedMessage which
 is checked by -[Message shouldBePGPProcessed].
 -[Message shouldBePGPProcessed] needs to know whether a message was selected
 by the user or if Mail.app tries to process it for generating the snippets.

@interface NSAttributedString (GPGMail)

/**
 Creates an icon just like the S/MIME sign icon, which performs an action
 on click. Based on the given link a different action is performed.
 
 It's not possible to use the SignedTextAttachment which is used by mail for the
 signed icon, because it calls a hard coded method, which can't be changed. Instead
 this behaviour is emulated using an NSAttachment with a GPGTextAttachmentCell and
 the NSAttributedString link attribute.
 
 A click on the icon calls the method - (BOOL)textView:clickedOnLink:atIndex: on the delegate
 of the view displaying the attributed string.
